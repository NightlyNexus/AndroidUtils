AndroidUtils
============

Some helper code for Android app development.

* `AndroidUtils` helper methods to check for an active or unmetered network connection, external storage state availability.
* `CheatSheet` by [Roman Nurik][1] to display info toasts for any view (similar to action items).
* `GenericSimpleLoader` offers a basic `AsyncTaskLoader` implementation to load simple objects or a list of objects.
